      <description>9p I read The Styx Architecture for Distributed Systems over a decade ago. The central idea of the paper is that &amp;ldquo;representing a computing resource as a form of file system, [makes] many of the difficulties of making that resource available across the network disappear&amp;rdquo;. By resource they mean any resource. For example in the Plan9 window system 8Â½, windows and even the mouse are implemented as a files; similarly, in Inferno and Plan9 the interface to the TCP/IP network is presented as a file system hierarchy.</description>
